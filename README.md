# **I am Legend**
I really like this movie because it is one of the goated movie of Will Smith also it was a zombie apocalypse movie.
Even tho the movie is very different from the book it was based on but independently it was still  a good movie for me.
This movie was intense and contain enough drama to make you feel emotion towards the characters.
My favorite scene for me is when the zombies discovered his secret base and raid it. 
The saddest scene for me is when he lost his bestfriend(German sheperd) and have to mercy kill it before it turns into a monster.
